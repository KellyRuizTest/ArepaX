        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><code>:: What is Blockchain?</code></h3>

        <blockquote> <p>A blockchain is essentially just a record, a digital event ledger that is "distributed" or shared among many different parties. It can only be updated based on the consensus of the majority of participants in the system and, once entered, the information can never be deleted. The Bitcoin blockchain contains an accurate and verifiable record of all the transactions that have been made in its history.</p>
            <p>Marc Andreessen, creator of Netscape</p></blockquote>

        <blockquote><p>This is the fundamental principle that supports Block chain o Blockchain, a technology that has the power to forever change our relationship with the digital world.</p></blockquote>

        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><code>:: What is Bitcoin? -> Bitcoin is a software, a protocol and a currency.</code></h3>

        <blockquote> <p>hese three characteristics allow one of the applications of Bitcoin to be that of forming a global, transparent, open source, and single currency based payment network.

            The currency was devised as a decentralized economic system open to all, which proposed to its users a monetary and exchange system of value better than the current fiat money system. The value of this currency depends on the trust of users and is not controlled or regulated by any bank, which is why its value is so volatile. One of the great peculiarities of Bitcoin is that its creator is unknown. </p></blockquote>

        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><code>:: What is Private Key?</code></h3>

        <blockquote> <p>a private key or private key, is a secret key generated by the process of asymmetric cryptography. 
            This key is the one that allows the total ownership and management of our cryptocurrency wallets. 
            In Bitcoin, this key is generated using cryptography of the type ECDSA, using the elliptic curve secp256k1. 
            This is a special type of asymmetric cryptography, which we provides a high level of security.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><code>:: What is Public Key?</code></h3>

        <blockquote> <p>a public key, is one of the two keys generated by a asymmetric cryptography. It receives this name, by its name in English, public key. Asymmetric cryptography is a crucial component for the operation of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Without it there could be no cryptocurrencies as we know them. This system allows us to generate a pair of keys that are no more than two cryptographically linked text strings. These keys are called: private key y public key. In this explanation we will focus on the second of them.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><code> What is Bitcoin address?</span></code></h3>

        <blockquote> <p>in the world of cryptocurrencies, is the place to which a certain amount of cryptocurrencies is associated. Every person or user who wants to send or receive cryptocurrencies will always need an address.

            The address works just like in the traditional financial system, to receive or send money transfers. Which means that a kind of bank account works. In Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, this is known as "address" o "Wallet address" in the English language. The purpose of the addresses is to allow us to receive and send cryptocurrencies.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align: left;"><code>:: What is Smart Contract?</code></h3>

        <blockquote> <p>To understand a smart contract, we must first remember what a contract means. A contract is nothing more than an agreement between two or more parties, an environment where you define what can be done, how it can be done, what happens if something is not done. In other words, some rules of the game that allow all parties that accept it to understand what the interaction they are going to do will consist of.

            Until now, contracts have been verbal documents or expensive written documents. These documents are subject to territorial laws and jurisdictions, and sometimes require notaries. In other words, more costs, time and third parties involved in the process. Because of this, they are not accessible to anyone.</p>
